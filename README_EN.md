# ANYUES · Explore the Universe. Sense the Earth.

[简体中文](README.md) | [English](README_EN.md)

Current version: **1.9.0**. See the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

**Live demo:** [https://lab.anyues.com/solar-system/](https://lab.anyues.com/solar-system/)

Double-click **index.html** in this directory to launch ANYUES. Three.js and 15 textures, including Earth's original 8K day and night maps, are embedded in the HTML, so universe exploration requires no internet connection, dependency installation, or local server. EarthSense fetches public data on demand. A current version of Chrome, Edge, or Safari with WebGL 2 and hardware acceleration enabled is recommended.

## Explore

- Drag to rotate the camera and use the mouse wheel to zoom. On touchscreens, drag with one finger to rotate and pinch with two fingers to zoom.
- Keep zooming out from Earth to move through the Solar System, the Milky Way, and the Galaxy Atlas. Zoom back in to return to the tracked body.
- Select a body from the bottom dock, the 3D scene, or a label to fly smoothly to it. Search the dock by Chinese or English name or catalog number.
- Explore **14 galaxies**: the Milky Way, Andromeda, Triangulum, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, M32, M110, NGC 6822, Whirlpool M51, Bode’s M81, Cigar M82, Sombrero M104, Centaurus A, and M87. Selecting a galaxy opens its catalogued stars, planets, and black holes. Galaxy, stellar-system overview, and Galaxy Atlas controls return to wider views. The atlas spans multiple physical galaxy groups; see [new galaxy sources](docs/observed-galaxies-sources.md).
- Visit **27 real stellar targets beyond the Sun**. This release adds the host stars TRAPPIST-1, Kepler-186, and Kepler-22, plus Polaris A, Altair, Arcturus, Aldebaran, Deneb, Canopus, Antares A, and Barnard’s Star. HD 5980 remains a multiple-star system represented by one luminous object. See [new star sources](docs/observed-stars-sources.md).
- Visit **five black holes**: Sagittarius A*, the central black holes of M31 and M32, and the stellar-mass black holes M33 X-7 and LMC X-1. Shadows, photon rings, and animated accretion disks are artistic illustrations.
- Explore **10 confirmed exoplanets**: HR 8799 b/c/d/e, Proxima Centauri b, TRAPPIST-1 e/f/g, Kepler-186 f, and Kepler-22 b, plus **four explicitly fictional extragalactic giant-planet illustrations**. Fictional pairings and orbits are demonstrations, and every exoplanet surface is artistic. See the [deep-space catalog](docs/deep-space-sources.md) and [new planet sources](docs/milky-way-sources.md).
- Visit the **JWST exterior model**, featuring 18 mirror segments and five sunshield layers, with reversible deployment playback and normal rotation and zoom. Deployment is an educational illustration.
- Visit **Voyager 1** from the Solar System or Milky Way dock to inspect its antenna, booms, instrument body, and Golden Record. The orbit switch controls its illustrative trail. See [model and sources](docs/voyager-sources.md).
- Use **City Lights** and **Visit the Space Station** from the Earth panel.
- Jump between **Near-Earth Orbit**, **Solar System**, **Milky Way**, and **Galaxy Atlas** using the navigation at the top.
- Toggle orbits and labels independently. Pause celestial motion or switch between 0.25×, 1×, 5×, and 20× simulation speeds.
- Select **运动轨迹 (Motion Trails)** beside the orbit and label controls to follow the Sun and eight planets. Switch between Galactic and Sun reference frames and short or long histories, use the existing pause and speed controls, rotate and zoom freely, or choose **返回太阳系 (Return to Solar System)**.
- Warm meteoroids and comets with two soft tails occasionally cross the sky, one at a time at random intervals. They follow the pause control and are hidden in EarthSense and reduced-motion mode.
- Screen modes: Settings offers Universe Roaming (keep the current scene and controls, hide the interface), Celestial Portrait (one body or a whole galaxy), and Motion Trails (the Sun and eight planets in motion). Portraits support left/center/right framing and automatic cycling. Trail settings include only the reference frame, trail length, and left/center/right placement.
- Gestures: drag with one finger or a mouse to rotate; pinch or scroll to zoom. In Portrait mode, triple-tap the body or galaxy to advance; arrow keys switch in either direction. Double-tap or press `I` / `Esc` to restore the interface. Portrait and Motion Trails double-taps have a short delay to distinguish triple-taps. Triple-tapping Motion Trails cycles Galactic long, Galactic short, Solar long, and Solar short; the default direction matches the main Motion Trails view.
- Deep-space color, background stars, artificial satellites/ISS, and orbit visibility apply to exploration and every screen mode. The orbit switch stays synchronized with the home control and also controls screen-mode trails. Portraits hide orbits locally without changing the global preference. The browser remembers the mode, subject, color, framing, and cycling. All modes adapt automatically to the current screen size and orientation, with no device or screen preset to choose.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `+` / `-` to zoom, Space to pause, `H` to return to Earth, `F` for fullscreen, `I` to hide the interface, and `?` for help.

## Solar System Motion Trails

The Galactic reference view combines the Solar System’s overall translation with planetary motion around the Sun. The Sun reference view follows the Sun and removes that common translation so you can compare the paths. The Solar System does orbit the galactic center; NASA gives an orbital period of approximately 230 million years. [NASA Sun Facts](https://science.nasa.gov/sun/facts/), [NASA Solar System Facts](https://science.nasa.gov/solar-system/solar-system-facts/).

The Galactic reference is a **local illustration**. Historical trails are calculated backward from the demonstration model, with adjusted time, sizes, orbital periods, translation direction, and display proportions. A spiral shape seen from one viewpoint is not a unique true route through space or an observed ephemeris. See [motion-trail model and sources](docs/motion-trajectories.md).

## EarthSense

Choose **感知地球** to observe data on the existing Earth. The current interface has three independent layers: **weather, lightning, and tropical cyclones**, all enabled by default. Click a weather or thunderstorm cloud, or a cyclone cloud band, for its source, timestamp, coordinates, and measurements. Events are also searchable in the list; choose an entry to fly to its location, then zoom closer. Use the event list to inspect clear-weather locations with no clouds. The list places cyclones and lightning before weather samples.

EarthSense holds celestial motion while you explore the surface. Returning to universe mode restores the previous camera, destination, unfinished flight, speed and switches. Overlays hide when viewing another body or a wider astronomical scale. EarthSense uses the same Three.js Earth, renderer, camera and controls.

- Weather uses 60 Open-Meteo sampling locations to display temperature, wind, accumulated precipitation, rainfall, and cloud cover. Clear and mainly clear codes **0 and 1** produce no clouds or rain, and EarthSense hides the fixed decorative cloud map. Accumulation and its source interval are converted to mm/h to control rain density, speed, length, and spread. These samples do not form a continuous global weather field.
- Weather lightning appears only for thunderstorm codes **95, 96, and 99**. As the rain rate increases, its illustrative cycle shortens from about 18 seconds to 4 seconds. This animation expresses intensity; the source does not provide observed lightning frequency or individual strikes.
- Local weather clouds follow Earth's curvature, with translucent drifting wisps and shading that responds to the Sun. Thunderstorm flashes briefly illuminate their interiors. Cloud shape and motion are illustrative expressions of the sampled weather.
- Cyclones combine GDACS reports with up to 100 open severe-storm events from NASA EONET; matching duplicates prefer GDACS. Thin clouds, low eyewalls, open eyes, and unequal spiral bands use independently drifting detail and brief localized electrical glows. Reported wind continuously controls visual radius and rotation speed; GDACS event maxima and the selected advisory's current observations are labeled separately. Cloud shape and radius are illustrative, not satellite imagery or official wind boundaries; electrical glows do not represent observed strikes or lightning frequency.
- Selecting a cyclone loads its GDACS advisory's authentic history and forecast on demand. History uses a solid line, forecast a dashed line, and selectable positions show coordinates, wind speed, and validity time. Details retain the source and advisory time. Missing forecasts or an unidentified current advisory are explained without extrapolating a path. EONET supplies historical positions but no official forecast. Closing details, disabling cyclones, leaving Earth, or switching modes cancels the route request and clears the selected route.
- The separate lightning layer contains **six simulated thunderstorm locations**, clearly labeled and enabled by default. Their clouds, rain, and lightning are demonstrations.

Each layer distinguishes loading, empty results, failures, partial availability and stale cached data. Leaving the mode cancels requests and stops refreshing. See [data sources](docs/data-sources.md) and [refactor validation](docs/refactor-validation.md). Event times are source records and may be delayed.

Universe exploration and EarthSense share the same detailed Earth maps, finer geometry, original day/night shading, and original bloom settings. Switching modes preserves texture quality and lighting. Detailed maps prepare asynchronously at startup: desktop prefers **8192 × 4096**, while phone layouts or devices reporting no more than 4 GB of memory prefer **4096 × 2048**, subject to the GPU texture-size limit. Unsupported devices or failed loads retain the original 2K maps. The 4K upload is generated at runtime from the unchanged 8K source. The original decorative cloud map appears in universe mode; EarthSense displays local clouds and rain driven by sampled weather.

## Implementation

ANYUES uses Three.js r185 and includes Earth day/night shading, city lights, an independent cloud layer, an atmospheric rim, 32 satellites, a simplified International Space Station, the Moon, the Sun, all eight planets, transparent Saturn rings, and Solar System orbits. Deep-space exploration adds 14 procedural galaxies with spiral arms, elliptical halos, irregular star fields, and dust lanes, five black-hole models, independent stellar systems, JWST and Voyager 1 models, procedural star, rocky, icy, and gas-giant surfaces, and lighting directed toward each planet’s host star. Bodies and orbits appear according to viewing distance. The renderer uses logarithmic depth buffering, bloom post-processing, and a responsive interface.

This is an interactive visualization. Body sizes, distances, orbital positions, and speeds are adjusted for visual presentation rather than real-time astronomical accuracy. Satellite, station, and spacecraft models use display proportions. All 14 galaxies are illustrative; this destination count is not the complete membership of a physical galaxy group. Close-range HUD distances are converted from visual units for demonstration.

## Debugging Interface

After the page loads, call `ANYUES.destinations()` in the browser console to inspect 14 galaxies and 46 bodies beyond the Solar System. Entries provide IDs, names, kinds, galaxy membership, host stars, and model status. Visit spacecraft directly with `ANYUES.goTo('voyager-1')` or `ANYUES.goTo('jwst')`. Existing navigation IDs remain compatible.

```js
console.table(ANYUES.destinations());
ANYUES.goTo('sagittarius-a'); // Explore the Milky Way’s central black hole
ANYUES.goTo('m32');          // Fly to M32
ANYUES.goTo('local-group'); // Galaxy Atlas overview
ANYUES.goTo('andromeda');   // Fly to Andromeda
ANYUES.goTo('hr8799-b');    // Fly to a confirmed giant planet
ANYUES.getState();          // Includes activeGalaxyId, activeSystemId, and the current scale
```

In the new catalog, `modelStatus: 'confirmed'` identifies real objects, while `'illustration'` identifies fictional destinations. Surface artwork, scene proportions, and orbital animation remain illustrative for confirmed objects too.
